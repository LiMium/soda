## Goal
To build a legible layout engine that is close to the theoretical model defined in CSS specs.

## Scope

Only static layout and rendering, which implies:
  * No scrolling, hovering, selecting, resizing and other user interactions
  * No form controls
  * No Cursors
  * No animations, HTML5 Canvas
  * No DOM manipulations through Javascript, etc
  * No CSS DOM
  * Synchronous operations for loading resources like images, stylesheets, etc

Low priority:
  * Border styles
  * Border radius
  * Box Shadows
